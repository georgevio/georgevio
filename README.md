## 👋 Hi, I'm George Violettas

R&D manager, expert in embedded systems, IoT protocols, and (far) edge computing. I specialize in IoT systems archtiectural design, protocols like RPL, BLE, curently working on ESP-IDF build systems, and Zenoh-Pico, targeting real-world deployment and applications, and biometric sensor integration. I value precision, autonomy, and clarity in both code and communication. ***AI rocks!***

## 🔧 Featured Projects

### 🧩 [IoT-Embedded](https://github.com/georgevio/IoT-Embedded)
A collection of embedded examples for ESP32-CAM and ESP32-S3 using ESP-IDF and Arduino. Includes WebSocket servers, face detection, biometric sensors (e.g. BME280), and modular setups for real-world IoT deployment.

### 🛡️ [ASSET](https://github.com/georgevio/ASSET)
**PhD Thesis.** Centralized SDN-inspired intrusion detection system for RPL-based IoT networks. It monitors network topology via Contiki/Cooja, detects attacks like rank and grayhole, and uses k-means and Kosaraju algorithms to identify malicious nodes.
